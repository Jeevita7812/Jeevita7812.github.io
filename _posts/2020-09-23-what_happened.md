Its been a while since my last post. From the past few weeks I wake up at 4 to 4:30 am. Which is quite early for me and as usual I woke up but I realized it was raining heavily, while raining the sky was golden-yellow in color as it's the time for sunrise. The sky was looking very mesmerizing.I applied to new courses in Coursera like Introduction to AI, Algorithmic Toolbox, and React JS. I wrote some tests and practices from Byjus', its a learning app. It has Maths and Science, it also has previous year question papers on different subjects. Also on 29 of this month I am going to have my 2nd O.T (Objective Test). I wrote the first one on 5 of this month and I got a score of 56/60. We only have to prepare MPC(Maths, Physics and Chemistry) for O.T. And about HackerEarth my weekly rank of today was 6,196. ;)
