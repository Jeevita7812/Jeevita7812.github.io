Project Euler is a website made for a mathematicaphile or mathphile (people who love math). It contains competitive questions. The questions were neither difficult nor easy, they were just right. The Saathi app has NCERT based related questions of Science and Maths. Today I completed 3 questions from HackerEarth, and 2 from ProjectEuler. And I had my usual online classes, which are not so interesting. I read some e-books, comics. The weather too was as good as my day.  ;)
