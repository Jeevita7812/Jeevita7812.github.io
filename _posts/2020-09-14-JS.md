Yesterday on 13 Sept I completed learning about javascript from youtube. And today I had learnt a bit of NodeJS by the same youtuber. JavaScript wasn't that hard after learning python and knowing few basics from C. It is just that JS is a lightweight interpreted programming language. The web browser receives the JS code in its original text form and runs the script from that. We can do many cool things using JS.
