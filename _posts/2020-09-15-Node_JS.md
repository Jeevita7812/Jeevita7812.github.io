As I said yesterday, I was learning about NodeJS from a youtuber. They were nearly 37 videos in the playlist about NodeJS and I saw 20 of them yesterday and the remaining ones I completed them today around 3:30. And I also started to do questions on HackerEarth. It is a platform where their are questions and we write the code to solve them. I usually use python but for HackerEarth I am using C++ to solve them and if I had any doubt my brother would help me or I would search that up on google or on GeeksforGeeks. It was a bit hard but once you understand it, it's easy. I had my online classes and spoke with my friend after a week or two. After that I watched few videos of Master Chef Canada. It was a pretty good day.
