As I said yesterday, I was learning about NodeJS from a youtuber. Today around 3:30 I completedlearning about it. It was a bit hard but once you understand it, it's easy. I had my online classes and spoke with my friend after a week or two. After that I watched few videos of Master Chef Canada. It was a pretty good day. It wasn't tiring and it was funny.
